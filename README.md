# Placement-Prediction-System-

Placement Prediction System predicts the probability of an  undergrad 
student getting placed in an IT company by applying the machine learning models k
nearest neighbor’s classification, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision 
tree, random forest, gradient boosting classifier. The system also compares the results 
obtained by the models against each other. The system predicts the probability based on 
the features like programming skills, communication skills, analytical skills and team 
work which are tested by the hiring companies during the recruitment process. 
The efficiency of the existing system decreases with the increase in the  
amount of data. The prediction of the existed system was limited to the small data and 
does not perform well with the big data. 
The proposed system uses neural networks to overcome the limitation of 
the existing system. Neural networks are becoming increasingly popular in big data 
analysis because of their efficiency in handling and analyzing large volumes of data. 
The machine learning models demonstrate a significant improvement in predicting 
student’s placement outcomes compared to traditional methods. Student’s can use these 
predictions to focus on improving specific skills or areas and increase their chances of 
securing job offers.



The code also consists of a GUI for friendly user Interaction.
